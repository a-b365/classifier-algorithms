# Tabular-data classification

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline designed to handle high-dimensional datasets with limited sample sizes. The primary challenge addressed is the "curse of dimensionality" where the number of features (3238) significantly exceeds the number of samples (315).

---

## Features

- **Robust Processing Pipeline**: Missing value handling, outlier detection, feature filtering, and scaling
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Feature selection and power transformation
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Multiple algorithms with tuning and comprehensive metrics
- **Performance Analysis**: Side-by-side performance comparison

---

## Technical Approach

**Core Methods:**
- Median imputation and IQR-based outlier handling (feature-wise)
- Normalize skewed features, remove near-constant and highly correlated features
- Feature selection based on mutual information
- Hyperparameter tuning and Stratified Cross Validation

**Stack:**
- `scikit-learn`, `scipy`, `imblearn`
- Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Helper libs: `numpy`, `pandas`

- **Predicted Labels**: Predicted labels for each dataset in `results/`
---

## Methodology

**Preprocessing:**
- Infinite Handling
- Median Imputation
- Variance Filtering
- Correlation Filtering

**Feature Engineering**
- Outlier Treatment
- Power Transformation
- Robust Scaling
- Feature Selection

**Model Training and Evaluation**
- Cross Validation
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Class Balancing
- Performance Metrics

---

## Usage

- Run the desired Python module directly from the command line.
- This will run one classifier at a time:
  - Logistic Regression: Produces all classification metrics along with the comparison
  - Decision Tree: Generates initial performance metrics and improved performance
  - Random Forest: Produces the same results as other classifiers
- Note: The results of all classifiers are in the similar format

---

## Notes

  - A detailed project report is available in the docs/ folder
  - Run the Jupyter notebook inside the notebooks/ folder for an interactive walkthrough of the implementation
  - Blinded test set results can be found in the results/
